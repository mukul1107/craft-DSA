# Problem Set Repository

Welcome to the Problem Set Repository! This repository contains a collection of coding problems crafted by the contributors for practice and learning purposes.

## File Structure:

- **problems/**
  - Contains problem descriptions in various programming languages.
- **solutions/**
  - Houses solutions to the problems presented in the `problems` directory.
- **README.md**
  - Provides an overview of the repository and guidelines for contributions.

## Problems Format:

Each problem is structured as follows:

```js
 Problem Name == ** Remove 'n'th Element ** from the array.
 Given is an array 'nums' of 'k' elements where 'k' stands for the size of the array.
 The motive of the exercise is to remove the number of 'nth' space element from the array of size 'k'. 


    nums = [k,k,k,k,k,k,k,k,k,k];
    /n = 2
     Task is to remove every nth space element from the array.
     nums = [k , REMOVED, k , REMOVED, k , REMOVED, k, REMOVED, k, REMOVED]

```

## Contribution Guidelines:

- Please contribute new problems by creating a new file in the `problems` directory, following the specified format.
- Solutions to the problems can be added to the `solutions` directory. Ensure each solution file is appropriately named and matches the corresponding problem file.
